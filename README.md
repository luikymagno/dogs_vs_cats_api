# Dogs vs Cats API
The goal of this API is to assemble different tools and techniques, such as FastAPI, Docker, Tensorflow, Transfer Learning and so on, to deploy a simple application built to be maintainable and scalable by respecting the good practices of software development.
This API provides an endpoint that tells the client if the picture he uploaded has either a cat or a dog in it.
